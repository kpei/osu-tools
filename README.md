Tools for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh).

# Requirements

- A desktop platform with the [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
- When working with the codebase, we recommend using an IDE with intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting, such as the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- These instructions assume you have the the [CLI git client](https://git-scm.com/) installed, but any other GUI client such as GitKraken will suffice.
- Note that there are **[additional requirements for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60#dependencies)** which you may need to manually install if your operating system is not up-to-date.

# Getting Started

## I just want to run it
- Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools`)
- Navigate to each tool's directory and follow the instructions listed in the tool's README.
    - [PerformanceCalculator](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools/blob/master/PerformanceCalculator/README.md) - A tool for calculating the difficulty of beatmaps and the performance of replays.
    - [PerformanceCalculatorGUI](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools/blob/master/PerformanceCalculatorGUI/README.md) - A GUI tool for calculating the difficulty of beatmaps, changes in profile scores and leaderboards.

## I want to make changes
Most relevant code is in the main [ppy/osu](htts://github.com/ppy/osu) repository. To make any meaningful changes you will likely need to edit that as well.

- Clone all relevant repos into the same directory (`git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools`; `git clone https://github.com/ppy/osu`)
- Run the `./UseLocalOsu.ps1` powershell script (or `./UseLocalOsu.sh`) to use your local copy of ppy/osu
